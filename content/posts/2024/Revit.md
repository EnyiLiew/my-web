# Using Revit for Quantity Surveying: My Experience

In Year 3 Semester 1, I had the opportunity to explore different software tools to gain a clearer understanding of what a quantity surveyor does. In the Computer-Aided Quantity Surveying course, I worked on several hands-on projects, but one of the most interesting tasks was using Revit to create two different conceptual designs and compare them in terms of dimensions and costs. This task was definitely a challenge—but challenge accepted!

## Setting up the Revit model

I started by analyzing the provided floor plan in the assignment. After verifying all the details, it was time to create the models. I carefully constructed key building elements, including floors, curtain walls, walls, and roofs, ensuring that the materials were chosen according to the given requirements. With this, the first design (Design A) was completed.

Since the assignment required a comparison between two alternative designs, I created the second model by duplicating Design A. As there were only a few differences, I modified the duplicated model to form Design B and updated the materials accordingly.

## Creating Schedules for Cost Estimation

Once the models were ready, I generated various schedules to calculate key quantities that impact the project cost, including:

- Floor schedules – Different materials like concrete and metal deck, listed with their respective costs.
- Roof schedules – Included details such as steel bar joists and membrane layers.
- Curtain system & wall schedules – Estimated costs for external walls and façade systems.
- Mass floor schedule – Included details such as floor area, perimeter, volume, exterior surface area, cost estimate, floor usage type, and cost estimate by floor usage type, along with a grand total for each category.
- Multi-category material takeoff – Calculated the material area, unit cost, and total cost for various building components.

These schedules were generated for both designs, allowing a clear comparison of their differences. Each schedule provided a detailed breakdown of materials and costs, helping to estimate the overall project budget.

## Finalizing the Sheets
For the final step of this assignment, I submitted the schedules in PDF format. As required, I compiled all schedules into a single sheet to showcase the cost differences between the two designs. To improve readability and presentation, I carefully arranged the scaling, formatting, and layout, making the information easy to interpret.

## Final Thoughts
This assignment was a great learning experience that deepened my understanding of how Revit can be used for quantity surveying. From modeling building elements to generating cost schedules, I saw firsthand how BIM technology enhances accuracy and efficiency in construction cost estimation. While the task had its challenges, it pushed me to think critically and apply my technical skills in a practical way. I look forward to exploring more advanced applications of Revit in future projects!
