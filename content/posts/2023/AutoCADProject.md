# Creating a Front Elevation Drawing Using AutoCAD: My Experience
As part of my coursework in Computer-Aided Design and Drafting (CADD) during **Year 1 Trimester 2**, 
I had the opportunity to apply my technical skills in a practical assignment—producing a **Front
Elevation Drawing** based on a given floor plan. This task challenged me to utilize technical drafting skills, 
scale adjustments, and architectural detailing to create a precise representation of the structure.

## Understanding the Floor Plan
Before starting this project, I carefully analyzed the ground floor, first floor, and roof plan provided. Key design elements:
- Floor Heights: 3000mm per floor
- Roof Structure: 100mm × 50mm rafters with 50mm coverings
- Doors & Windows: Referenced from the provided door & window schedule
- Scaling & Proportions: Ensuring correct alignment and accurate representation in A4 size

After verifying all the details, it was time to start the work!


## The Process
First Step: Setting Up the AutoCAD File  
- Imported the floor plan given by the lecturer and set up the working scale.  
- Identified the front-facing elements of the building for the elevation view.

*This is the floor plan i received.*

Second Step: Drafting the Structural Components  
- Started with the ground floor, drawing grid lines extended from the floor plan to ensure the correct positioning of elements.
- Aligned walls, doors, and windows accurately according to the schedule.
- Used different layers to organize the drawing. For example, dotted lines were used as hidden lines and later hidden since they were only for reference.

*Ground Floor completed!*

- Moved on to the first floor, ensuring proper alignment with the structure below.

*First Floor done too!*

Third Step: Roofing & Architectural Details  
- The roof was a bit tricky, as the exact height was not provided.
- Used the given plan dimensions and slope degree to draft the roof accurately.

*Roof all set!*

Last Step: Refinements & Final Touches  
- Double-checked window and door placements according to the schedule.   
- Once all the floors were completed, it was time for 'LEGO time'—assembling everything into a complete building.

*Tadaaa!*

- Ensured everything was scaled correctly to fit an A4 layout.  
- Time to adjust the printing setting and print out as PDF format.

## Final Thoughts

Final Thoughts
This assignment strengthened my AutoCAD skills and gave me a deeper understanding of architectural elevations. 
By translating a 2D floor plan into a front elevation, I gained valuable insights into building design, scaling techniques,
 and construction detailing—all of which are essential in architectural drafting and construction planning.

Although I encountered some challenges while working on this assignment, I am grateful to have supportive 
course mates who were always willing to help. Discussing problems and solving them together made the learning 
process much more enjoyable.

This was my first time working on a building-related project, after spending the previous classes drawing simpler 
shapes. While my skills may not be highly sophisticated yet, I am eager to keep learning and improving. This experience has 
motivated me to further develop my technical abilities and gain more hands-on practice in architectural drafting.

Thanks for reading. ^^
